## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Reward Preservation**: ≥98% of full-precision baseline
- **Memory Budget**: ≤32KB RAM, ≤128KB Flash
- **Latency**: ≤5ms inference time on Cortex-M55
- **Power**: ≤10mW average power consumption

### Quality Gates
- **Test Coverage**: ≥95% unit test coverage
- **Security**: Zero high/critical CVEs
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime in field testing
- **Documentation**: 100% API documented

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Quantization Degradation**: Implement progressive quantization with early stopping
- **Memory Overflow**: Use static analysis and runtime guards
- **Compiler Compatibility**: Test on multiple toolchains (GCC, Clang, ARM)

### Process Risks
- **Timeline Slippage**: Weekly sprint reviews with burndown tracking
- **Quality Issues**: Automated gates with manual review for critical paths
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular dependency updates and security scanning

## Monitoring & Reporting

### Weekly Metrics
- Sprint velocity (story points completed)
- Bug count and resolution time
- Test coverage trends
- Performance benchmark results

### Monthly Reviews
- Architecture compliance check
- Security posture assessment
- Documentation completeness
- Release readiness status

## Continuous Improvement

- Monthly retrospectives to identify process improvements
- Quarterly architecture reviews to assess technical debt
- Annual security audits and penetration testing
- Regular dependency updates and maintenance windows
